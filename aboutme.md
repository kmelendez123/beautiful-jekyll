Hello again!
My name is Kevin and I have graduated from Radford University in Virginia with a B.S in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. I currently work as a Software Engineer and consultant at a company named STSI based in Rosslyn, VA. I am also an AWS Certified Developer at an Associate level and really want to continue learning more about cloud services.

As an avid programmer and engineer, it only makes sense that I love to game and build PC's. Apart from these I enjoy playing poker, meeting new people, and have an ambition to travel several countries in Asia and Europe. I also support open source contributions, so if you want to collab and work on something, or simply have a question, connect with me by following the media links below.
