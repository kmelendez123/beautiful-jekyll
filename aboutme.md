Hello again!
My name is Kevin and I have graduated from Radford University in Virginia with a B.S in Computer Science - Software Engineering.
I am pursuing a career as a web or software developer and am also an aspiring cloud guru. I am currently planning to take the AWS Certified Developer - Associate Exam (CDA) and learn more about the cloud. 

As an avid programmer and engineer, it only makes sense that I love to game and build PC's. Apart from these I enjoy playing poker, meeting new people, and have an ambition to travel several countries in Asia and Europe. I also support open source contributions, so if you want to collab and work on something, or simply have a question, connect with me by following the media links below.
